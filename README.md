This project combines two useful health tools — a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator and an Ideal Weight calculator — into a single Java program. The application accepts user inputs (height, weight, gender), computes BMI and its category, and estimates ideal weight using the Devine formula (converted to metric). The report covers purpose, methods, expected outputs, and includes full Java source code. This document outlines the purpose, approach, and code for a simple console-based Java application that calculates BMI and estimates ideal body weight. The program is intended for educational use, demonstration in project presentations, or as a small utility. Maintaining a healthy weight is a cornerstone of public health. BMI is a widely used screening measure to categorize weight status. Ideal weight estimates help guide discussions on healthy weight ranges. Combining these two calculators produces a convenient utility for quick personal assessment. Many users need a simple, reliable tool to: Compute BMI from height and weight, Interpret BMI using standard categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese), Estimate an "ideal" weight given height and gender to provide a target reference.
